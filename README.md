Terrascan detects security vulnerabilities and compliance violations across your Infrastructure as Code. Mitigate risks before provisioning cloud native infrastructure. Run locally or integrate with your CI\CD.


* Documentation: https://docs.accurics.com/projects/accurics-terrascan
* Discuss: https://community.accurics.com

## Features
* 500+ Policies for security best practices
* Scanning of Terraform (HCL2)
* Scanning of Kubernetes (JSON/YAML), Helm v3, and Kustomize v3
* Support for AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes and GitHub


## Quick Start
### Step 1: Install
Terrascan's supports multiple ways to install, including [brew](https://github.com/accurics/terrascan#install-via-brew).
Here, we will download the terrascan binary directly from the [releases](https://github.com/accurics/terrascan/releases) page. Make sure to select the right binary for your machine. Here's an example of how to install it:

```sh
$ curl -L "$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/accurics/terrascan/releases/latest | grep -o -E "https://.+?_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz")" > terrascan.tar.gz
$ tar -xf terrascan.tar.gz terrascan && rm terrascan.tar.gz
$ install terrascan /usr/local/bin && rm terrascan
$ terrascan
```
### Step 2: Run
To scan your code for security issues you can run the following (defaults to scanning Terraform).

```sh
$ terrascan scan
```
Terrascan will exit 3 if any issues are found.

The following commands are available:

```sh
$ terrascan
Terrascan

  -x, --log-type string      log output type (console, json) (default "console")
  -o, --output string        output type (human, json, yaml, xml) (default "human")

Use "terrascan [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Step 3: Integrate with CI\CD
Please refer to our [documentation to integrate with your pipeline](https://docs.accurics.com/projects/accurics-terrascan/en/latest/integrations/cicd/).


## Rule Suppression
If a resource should not be tested against a particular rule, you can tell terrascan to skip it.

### Terraform
In Terraform scripts, you can tell terrascan to skip rules by inserting a comment with the phrase "ts:skip=RULENAME SKIP_REASON". The comment should be inside the resource.

### Kubernetes
In Kubernetes yamls, you can tell terrascan to skip rules by adding an annotation as seen in the snippet below.

### Broad Rule Suppression
Use our config file to manually pick which rules should be applied or suppressed from the entire scan. This is suitable for edge use cases. Please use in-file suppression to specify resources that shouldn't be tested against particular rules. This ensures that the rules are skipped only for particular resources, rather than all of the resources.
