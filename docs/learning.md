## Using Terrascan as a git pre-commit

Terrascan can be used on pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental introduction of security weaknesses into your repository.
This requires having [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) installed. An example configuration is provided in the comments of [.pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/accurics/terrascan/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml).yaml.
