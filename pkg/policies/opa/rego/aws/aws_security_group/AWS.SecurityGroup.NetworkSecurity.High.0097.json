    "description": "A VPC comes with a default security group whose initial settings deny all inbound traffic, allow all outbound traffic, and allow all traffic between instances assigned to the security group. If you don't specify a security group when you launch an instance, the instance is automatically assigned to this default security group. Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to AWS resources. It is recommended that the default security group restrict all traffic.Â Configuring the default security group to restrict all traffic will encourage least privilege security group development and mindful placement of AWS resource into security groups which will in-turn reduce the exposure of those resources.",
