## 1.0.0 (2020-08-16)
Major updates to Terrascan and the underlying architecture including:

- Pluggable architecture written in Golang. We updated the architecture to be easier to extend Terrascan with additional IaC languages and support policies for different cloud providers and cloud native tooling.
- Server mode. This allows Terrascan to be executed as a server and use it's API to perform static code analysis
- Notifications hooks. Will be able to integrate for notifications to external systems (e.g. email, slack, etc.)
- Uses OPA policy engine and policies written in Rego.

## 0.2.3 (2020-07-23)
- Introduces the '-f' flag for passing a list of ".tf" files for linting and the '--version' flag.
